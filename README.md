# React-Native-Expo-CLI-Anonymous-Chat-with-Firebase-Database


While working on this project, I used the Expo CLI. I utilized the Firebase database as the backend for this project.
The general purpose of this project is to have anonymous chat conversations. 
You can easily sign up and then create as many chat rooms as you want, which can also be deleted.
By entering the username of the user you want to add, you can invite them to join a chat room. Additionally, 
if you want to join a specific room, you can enter its ID and participate in the chat. Furthermore, the application stores your session,
so unless you explicitly log out, the application will open directly every time it is launched. 
You can have simple conversations with the people you want to talk to and remain completely anonymous.

NOTE: For security purposes, I commented out the "firebaseConfig" variable, which contained the information of the connected database.
